# The Game
N amount of points compete for the land. It is the war-free world therefore competition is more of a fare trade, not of an advantage overtake. Is it possible to have such model of the world at all?

## Run

`php simulate.php`

Initial output:  

```output

     .     . B-100     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
     .     .     B     .     .     .     . A-100     .     .
     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     A     .     .

```

Quite a lot to improve...
