# The Game
N amount of points compete for the land. It is the war-free world therefore competition is more of a fare trade, not of an advantage overtake. Is it possible to have such model of the world at all?

## Run

`php simulate.php`

Initial output:  

```output

     .   A-1     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
   A-5     A   A-3     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
   B-4     B   B-2     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
